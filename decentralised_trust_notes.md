Exploring the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence** and **Blockchain** â€” and how these technologies can shape the future of **trust**, **traceability**, and **decentralised intelligence**.

This repository includes early-stage thoughts, concepts, and idea sketches around:

- Building verifiable and auditable AI systems
- Leveraging blockchain to trace AI-driven decisions
- Decentralised AI agent coordination
- Combining domain-specific AI with immutable trust layers

These notes may evolve into prototypes, frameworks, or collaborations. Contributions or conversations welcome.

## Themes

- Decentralised intelligence
- Transparent automation
- Data provenance and trust
- AI-first vertical systems with embedded traceability
