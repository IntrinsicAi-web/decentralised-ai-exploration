# AI Agent + Smart Contract Interaction (Concept Demo)

This is a simple prototype exploring how an **AI agent** could evaluate an entity or event, assign a **trust score**, and log that score to a **blockchain smart contract**.

## ðŸ’¡ Concept

As AI agents begin to make or influence decisions in supply chains, identity, finance, or governance â€” it's essential that their actions are **verifiable** and **transparent**.

This script outlines the early thinking behind:
- Using AI to evaluate entities or behaviours
- Assigning a confidence or trust score
- Recording that score on-chain via a smart contract for traceability

## ðŸ”§ What's Inside

- `ai_agent_smart_contract_interaction.py`:  
  A simple script simulating:
  - AI-driven scoring logic
  - Smart contract interaction (pseudocode
